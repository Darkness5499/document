### What is the difference between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder in Java?
- String: Immutable, once created, it cannot be changed, Stored in string pool to save memory, concat, replace... => create a new string
- StringBuffer: Mutable, Synchronized, use when using multi-threaded enviroment
- StringBuilder: Mutable, not-synchronized, Faster than StringBuilder because no synchronization, use when run in single-thread
